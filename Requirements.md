# DEEP CONSULTING ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS :tada:

## Completed requirements:
- [x] Use a real-time world weather API service such as weatherstack.com
- [x] By default, users should be shown a list of the 15 largest cities in the world by population
in alphabetical order and the current temperature for each. Users should be able to
remove these entries individually from the list to clean it up.
- [x] Clicking on a city in the list should open a page where the user can see more weather
information. This view should include a textarea field where the user can enter and save
notes. Users should also be able to edit and remove notes.
- [x] Users should be able to use a search field to look up weather details for other cities.
- [x] Users should be able to add/remove cities as “favorites” which will appear at the top of
the list on the home screen (also in alphabetical order).
- [x] Except for the “search” feature, the app should retain basic functionality offline. The most
up-to-date information should be cached and persist in local storage.
- [x] The program should be built entirely as a front end application. There should be no
back-end or database (use only local storage).
- [x] Ask the user for permission
to get their current location and open the details page for their city after they grant it.
- [x] Functionality should be appropriately divided into well-defined components.
- [ ] Include unit testing for applicable functionality. (Test was added but not to all components, reason for not checking this)
- [x] The application should have a production-ready clean/modern aesthetic. Creatively
stylize the elements as you see fit, but do not use a UI framework (i.e. - Material UI,
Semantic UI, React Bootstrap, etc.)
- [x] Include screenshots and documentation in a [README.md](README.md) file
